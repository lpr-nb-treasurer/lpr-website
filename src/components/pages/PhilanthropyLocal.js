The NNCCF is the only organization that supports children fighting against cancer in the Northern and East Sierra regions of Nevada. Lambda Psi Rho has supported NNCCF every year with three major philanthropic events including Hoops For Hope, Lambda Psi Rholls, and Shave to Save. The Northern Nevada Children's Cancer Foundation strives to enhance the quality of lives of children battling cancer and their families by providing emotional and financial support. The NNCCF symbol is made up of flags which symbolize joy, hope, innocence and imagination. Hoops for Hope is our largest philanthropy of the year. Hosted in the Fall, we work directly with the NNCCF to host a week full of events that are solely focused on raising awareness and money for the foundation. At the end of the week, we host a basketball tournament for the Greek community to participate in. The gentlemen of Lambda Psi Rho host an all you can eat sushi roll event in support of the NNCCF every spring. The event runs from the late evening to the early hours of the morning with brothers serving sushi to continue the fight against childhood cancer.Shave to Save is a week following Lambda Psi Rholls. Members of the community come together and shave their heads to raise money to show solidarity for the numerous children fighting against cancer. The brothers of Lambda Psi Rho, along with many organizations on campus, participate in Shave to Save every year to support NNCCF.";
