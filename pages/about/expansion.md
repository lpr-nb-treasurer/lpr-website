    <p class="content has-text-weight-bold">How to Start?</p>
    <p class="content">
        Getting in contact with our head of expansion is the first step. We
        are open to all inquires, so please do not hesitate. Each school is
        unique and have different requirements to begin a
        club/group/organization. So we ask that you do a little research on
        how you can begin such group on your campus. From there, we will
        assist you in the steps on establishing chapter status through
        national recognition. From interest group to colony, to chapter
        status, it is the goal that you get national recognition by means of
        chapter status. Due note that since each campus has different
        requirements and procedures, that we also reserve the right to alter
        parts of the expansion process to meet our constitutional requirements
        and those requirements. With that being said, we recommend a group of
        determined young men to begin the expansion process, who can maintain
        good academic standing in accordance to their respective campus rules.
