        Lambda Psi Rho is an Asian-interest, but not Asian-exclusive,
        organization at the University of Nevada, Reno. We continuously
        promote brotherhood and diversity, foster leadership, succeed
        academically, and serve the community. We were established on February
        11th, 2006, by 11 distinguished gentlemen, and the active house
        continues their legacy by upholding our pillars of Leadership, Pride,
        and Respect.
