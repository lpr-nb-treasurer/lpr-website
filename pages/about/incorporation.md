        A corporation is a legal entity that can do anything a person can do.
        Think of it as an artificial person. It can buy and sell real estate,
        bring a lawsuit and be sued, or anything else that a natural person
        can do. Unlike a person, though, a corporation has perpetual life,
        which means it can go on forever.

        There are many types of corporations in business: publicly held
        corporations, domestic corporations, foreign corporations, for-profit
        corporations, non-profit corporations, limited liability corporations,
        and private corporations, to name a few. Regardless of the type,
        perhaps the greatest advantage of a corporation is limited liability.

        In some cases, there may be a need for separate corporations for the
        collegiate chapters and other chapters following, however, this is
        uncommon.

    <p class="content">
        Incorporation is the process of becoming a corporation in your state.
        Since the process varies from state to state, you will need further
        clarification for your situation. But here are the general steps that
        you need to follow:

    <p class="content">
        Every state has a department, usually part of the Secretary of State,
        that is responsible for corporations. Contact this department to see
        what the requirements are for starting a tax-exempt corporation. You
        are probably going to need:

        Articles of Incorporation. This document states the purpose of the
        corporation, the original incorporators, the life of the corporation,
        and how the corporate assets are disposed of when the corporation
        closes.

        Registered Agent. The registered agent must be a responsible adult in
        your state who can be served legal notices.

        Send a copy of your state certificate of incorporation to the National
        board so that it can be filed in your chapter's permanent file.

        Complete and file Form SS-4 with the Internal Revenue Service in order
        to receive your Federal Employer Identification Number (FEIN). Send
        this number to the Offices of the Grand Chapter so we can add your
        FEIN to our subordinate group list so that you will be exempt from
        federal taxes. This FEIN is the number you need in order to open a
        checking account at a local bank.

        Usually, you will be required to file an annual report and pay an
        annual fee in order to maintain registration as an active, tax-exempt
        corporation.

    <p class="content">
        Use this FEIN to also become a non-profit organization through your
        Secretary of State website.
